## Steps for Install
Unfortunately, the install button on the site page is not working at the moment, but! The Editor can be installed and used offline by clicking on the download button in the url address bar.

## User Instructions
Once the user has navigated to the deployed page, they just need to start typing. All of their text is automatically saved. And, as was stated above, to install onto their phone or desktop, the user just needs to click the "download" icon in the address bar.

Here are screenshots of the browser application and downloading it to the desktop:
